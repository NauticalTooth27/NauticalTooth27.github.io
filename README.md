# Readme

1. To my knowledge, all of the work has been correctly implemented.
2. I did not collaborate or discuss the work with anyone.
3. Roughly six hours were spent completing this assignment.

Lab: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio
1) This Git repository provides a portfolio to exhibit for internships 
etc.
2) My favorite assignment was either assignment 1, due to the utility of 
having a website (which opens a number of interesting future options), 
or assignment 4 due to the fun of it.
3) I have become far more comfortable with all things related to the 
web, from how it works at the low levels up to how to use high 
level frameworks.
4) The most important thing I learned in this course was how to 
figure out how to do things on my own; this was important in figuring 
out how to do responsive desing and learning how to use the Mailgun API 
for the semester group project.
5) I am interested in looking further into cybersecurity, which is why I 
am taking 116 next semester.
