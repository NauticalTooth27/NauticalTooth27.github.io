    <h1>Ryan Polhemus</h1>

    <p>
        Hi! I'm Ryan, a proud member of the Class of 2022 at Tufts University.
        I'm in the school of Engineering, and hope to major in computer science.
        I was born and raised in Massachusetts, and greatly enjoy the variety that the seasons bring.
        In my free time I enjoy playing soccer or tennis, reading, or playing video games.
